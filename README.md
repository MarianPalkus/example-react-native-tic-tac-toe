## Architecture Decisions Records (ADR)

Important decisions are logged using [architecture decisions records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io).
The adrs live in the directory `docs/adr` (see `.adr.json` for configuration).

Create a new adr:
`npm run adr-new "<title>"`

Related npm scripts:
 - `npm run adr-list`: list all ADRs
 - `npm run adr-export`: exports ADRs to html (`export.hmtl`)
