# 2. Use Typescript

Date: 2022-09-04

## Status

2022-09-04 proposed

## Context

The code should be written in a type safe programming language for a better development experience and to catch errors early in the editor/IDE. The programming language should be easy to integrate in the project with minimum setup overhead.

## Decision

The code should be written in Typescript.

## Consequences

- additional dependency on typescript
- code has to be written in typescript (though it is possible to write code in plain javascript)
